                This study introduces an Outlier-Driven Prediction Framework that combines machine learning models with outlier detection and hyperparameter tuning to improve ASD detection. The performance of Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Extra Trees was evaluated on high-dimensional, imbalanced clinical datasets. The local outlier factor (LOF) method was used for robust outlier detection. The study, using a dataset from the UCI ML Repository focused on adult ASD patients, achieved 98.97% accuracy with the Extra Trees classifier.

                This study explores deep learning techniques for detecting Alzheimer’s disease, including CNNs, hybrid models, ensemble methods, and transfer learning. CNNs are central in analyzing MRI images, while hybrid and ensemble models improve accuracy and robustness by combining algorithms. Transfer learning using pre-trained models enhances diagnosis, especially with limited data. Additionally, novel technologies like transformers and multi-stage frameworks complement existing methods. The research demonstrates that these integrated approaches significantly improve detection accuracy and early diagnosis, highlighting the impact of advanced deep learning technologies.

                This study proposes an integrated system for supervising e-transactions and detecting fraud using supervised learning techniques on Amazon SageMaker. By addressing class imbalance through weighted adjustments and synthetic data generation, and optimizing hyperparameters, the system enhances performance. Among the models tested, Random Forest proved to be the most accurate, achieving 99.98% accuracy, 99.97% precision, and 100% recall in detecting fraudulent transactions. The results highlight the effectiveness of AI cloud-based solutions like SageMaker in improving bank security against cyber threats.

                This study presents the development of a deep learning-based ATM transaction system designed to enhance security through real-time biometric authentication via face detection. By integrating dual authentication methods—facial recognition and PIN verification—the system creates a robust security model that effectively prevents unauthorized access and reduces the risk of fraud. Additionally, a secure database has been implemented to store user information and transaction logs, ensuring data integrity and compliance with privacy standards. This setup not only strengthens security but also facilitates efficient transaction management.
